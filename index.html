        <p Id="Web-security-answer">[I would advise a pentential client to first of all, ensure that everyone is aware of the different threats and risks there are. I would encourage to select a cybersecurity framework. And develop a cyber incident response plan. Then i would advise the client to automate and integrate as much as possible, so that it is less changes for human failure, and we can also notice problems and errors earlier.Another good practice is, to try and detect errors as soon as possible and eliminate them so that their not to damage. Try and keep yourself updated and educated in web security, and keep your computer updated and free from virus and errors.]</p>
